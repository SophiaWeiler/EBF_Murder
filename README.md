# EBF Murder Game
This is a murder mystery game where you are playing the role of detective, attempting to solve a murder. The game is set in a cabin in the woods. There are three suspects that will continuously give depositions and clues around each room that will provide evidence as to who committed the crime. The game will automatically take you from each room and you may not return once you leave the room.

# How to Run the game
To run this game you will need two prerequisites
1.  Install Python 3.6
2.  Install PIL (Python Imaging Library) 

Note:  This was coded specifically on Spyder, which can be found in the Anaconda Navigator Library, so it has been made to run specifically on that console. There are occasionally problems with some of the imported modules or pre-defined functions on other consoles so it is recomended that it be run on the Spyder console.

Once you have installed the prerequisites run the game by typing in

<code> python EBF_murder.py </code>
